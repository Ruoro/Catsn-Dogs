# Catsn-Dogs
Moringa IP week 10
Practice project on classification of images using tensor flow

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This week we learnt about Machine Learning. specifically: Deep learning. We were also tasked with learning about tensorflow and pytorch
I will be putting what I learnt to test with this dataset about cats and dogs

I intend to find out whether we can use the independent variables to come up with an accurate classification of whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

We intend to achieve an accuracy score of at least 80%. 

* Follow us to see whether we will be able to achieve an accuracy score of at least 80% or more


### Built With

Here are the major tools that we used for the data analysis

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Tableu Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Git](https://github.com/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I did this analysis with the intention of improving my skills in machine learning. However, the models used in this analysis could be used for deep learning to identify the contents of an image. with a good train dataset, the code in this can be scaled to identify different characters and contents of an image

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Following my analysis I identified some gaps in the data and would like to continue improving the dashboard and analysis in order to come up with a more accurate prediction
.
Some of the data that would have been nice to have are:

1. More variety of animals so our code could accurately identify other animals other than cats and dogs

### On a side note

Similar datasets for ________ in Kenya would be interesting to work on
